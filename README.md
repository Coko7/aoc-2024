# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2024

My code for the [Advent of Code - 2024 edition](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## ðŸ’¼ Workflow

- In [2022](https://github.com/coko7/aoc-2022), I had no workflow and was manually creating files every day.
- In [2023](https://github.com/coko7/aoc-2023), I spent some time making tools to automate small tasks (creating empty files, shared libs, build + run process) so I can focus on solving the puzzles right away.
- This year, I am giving a try to a [community-made template](https://github.com/fspoettel/advent-of-code-rust).
